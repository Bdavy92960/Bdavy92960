- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bdavy92960
- 👀 I’m interested in too many things to list them all, but the top of the list is astrophotography, flying RC airplanes, and boating. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to get my new consulting business up and running, having recently retired after 32 years of doing nuclear, worker, environmental, and public safety assessments for the Department of Energy and the NNSA 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting IMAC integrated into the OpenAero aerobatic sequence writing program. 
- 📫 The best way to reach me is via email at bdavy92960@msn.com
